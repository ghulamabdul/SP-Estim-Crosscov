# Semiparametric Estimation of Cross-covariance Functions for Multivariate Random Fields
This repository provides reproducible code for the manuscript titled *Semiparametric Estimation of Cross-covariance Functions for Multivariate Random Fields* by Ghulam A. Qadir, and Ying Sun. The manuscript describes a new semiparameteric approach to model the multivariate covariance function by flexibly specifying the underlying coherence functions through Bsplines. 

## Requirements

The codes are written in R, and would require installing and loading the following R-packages: #fields
